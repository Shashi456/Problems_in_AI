# Unsolved Problems in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
> Inspired by MIT Media labs Synthetic Neurobiology Labs, List of unsolved problems in Biology, I've decided to try and create a list for AI and DL. [CC: Thanks to Riva for this [tweet](https://twitter.com/rivatez/status/1121733391043502081)]


## Natural Language Processing

- Is perfect computational word-sense disambiguation attainable by using software? If yes, how and why? If no, why? (This presupposes the solution to the unsolved problems in the other areas of linguistics as a basis.)<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation)</sup>
- Is there an objective gauge for the quality of translation?<sup>[[citation needed]]()</sup>
  - Although in the Machine Translation space, BLEU scores currently exist, it's primarily a score for evaluating against a reference, if we truly want to surpass a human level translation, a better objective is needed.
- Is there an objective gauge for the quality of a summary?<sup>[[citation needed]]()</sup>
  - As mentioned in the case of BLEU scores, Summarization has ROUGE scores.
