# Unsolved/ Major Current Problems in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
> Inspired by MIT Media labs Synthetic Neurobiology Labs, List of unsolved problems in Biology, I've decided to try and create a list for AI and DL. [CC: Thanks to Riva for this [tweet](https://twitter.com/rivatez/status/1121733391043502081)]


## Natural Language Processing

- Is perfect computational word-sense disambiguation attainable by using software? If yes, how and why? If no, why? (This presupposes the solution to the unsolved problems in the other areas of linguistics as a basis.)<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation)</sup>
- Is there an objective gauge for the quality of translation?<sup>[[citation needed]]()</sup>
  - Although in the Machine Translation space, BLEU scores currently exist, it's primarily a score for evaluating against a reference, if we truly want to surpass a human level translation, a better objective is needed.
- Is there an objective gauge for the quality of a summary?<sup>[[citation needed]]()</sup>
  - As mentioned in the case of BLEU scores, Summarization has ROUGE scores.
- Natural Language Understanding 
  - Understanding Language is not just about assimilation but also about appreciating and extrapolating from it.
  - Current problems for NLI include SNLI and MNLI, but is predicting a result from a premise and hypothesis true NLI is something we should explore, maybe a reformalization of the task can also be looked at. 
- AI peer review<sup>[[3]](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ai-can-solve-peer-review-ai-can-solve-anything/)</sup>




## AI systems 

- Exhibiting Common Sense<sup>[[citation needed]]()</sup>
  - Might sound farfetched but true AI systems have to exhibit common sense to some degree if not completely. I do not know anyone actively working in this area of research. 
- Dealing with Unexpected circumstances <sup>[[citation needed]]()</sup>
  - One of the pitfalls of AI systems, currently is assuming the existence of near perfect environments, We need to create environments which are probabilistic in the sense that they might throw something randomly into the environment. 
- Fair AI systems and an objective gauge of Fairness in Ai systems <sup>[[citation needed]]()</sup>
  - In the past year or so, we have seen how AI systems are unfair and that this is a function of the data they have been trained on because human curation has let the biases of humans seep into the data and that data inherently when rawly collected has biases imbued as well. 
  - To solve this problem, One of the primary things to do is what is the meaning of fairness and how do you objectively gauge it?
